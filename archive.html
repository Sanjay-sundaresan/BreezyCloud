      <b>W</b>elcome to BreezyCloud archives. You can find weather records for
      years 2001 through 2018 in these embedded excel sheets. Every sheet
      contains data for one year. There are 6 tables of data in every sheet, so
      6 data parameters for every year. The years are listed at the bottom of
      the sheet. Click to view records of the year of your choice.
      <br /><br />*If you find that a random cell is selected, use the smaller
      navigation bar at the right side of the sheet, the larger bar immediately
      next to it, and the horizontal navigation bar at the bottom of the sheet
      in order to select the cell of your choice.<br /><br />Use the icons in
      the bottom right of the excel sheet to download the data.
